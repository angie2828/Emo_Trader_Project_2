Has Inflation contributed to Crypto Sentiment? - We will be analyzing the correlation between the value of Bitcoin, Gold and Inflation. We will also analyze how the sentiments of Bitcoin and if they have had an effect on the price of this asset class. 

Inflation happens when a jump occurs in the overall price of goods and services such as housing, food, fuel, transportation, and clothing. But gold helps serve as a shield against the weakened buying power of paper money that arises from a broad increase in the price of goods and services. Gold is commmly referred to as a hedge against inflation.
